          # [Feature] Collaboration
          Adds tables and policies to allow project sharing and collaboration.

          ## Query Description: "This operation will create the necessary structure for inviting collaborators to your projects. It includes a table to manage invitations and permissions, and updates security policies to allow shared access. It is a foundational step for team features."
          
          ## Metadata:
          - Schema-Category: "Structural"
          - Impact-Level: "Low"
          - Requires-Backup: false
          - Reversible: true
          
          ## Structure Details:
          - Creates table `project_collaborators` to store user roles per project.
          - Updates RLS policies on main tables (`projects`, `budget_entries`, `actual_transactions`, etc.) to grant access based on collaboration roles.
          
          ## Security Implications:
          - RLS Status: Enabled/Modified
          - Policy Changes: Yes
          - Auth Requirements: Users must be authenticated.
          
          ## Performance Impact:
          - Indexes: Adds indexes on foreign keys in `project_collaborators`.
          - Triggers: None
          - Estimated Impact: Low. Queries for data will now include a check on the collaborators table.
