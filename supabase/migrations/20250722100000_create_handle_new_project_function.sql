/*
# [Function] Create Project Handler
Creates a secure function to handle new project creation.

## Query Description:
This script creates a PostgreSQL function `handle_new_project`. This function is called by the application to create a new project, assign ownership to the current user, and create a default cash account. It ensures that all operations are performed securely within the database. This is a safe, non-destructive operation.

## Metadata:
- Schema-Category: ["Structural"]
- Impact-Level: ["Low"]
- Requires-Backup: false
- Reversible: true (the function can be dropped)

## Structure Details:
- Function: `public.handle_new_project`

## Security Implications:
- RLS Status: Not applicable to function creation itself, but the function is designed to work with RLS policies.
- Policy Changes: No
- Auth Requirements: The function uses `auth.uid()` to get the current user's ID.
